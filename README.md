## 100 PyTorch exercises

This is a fork of the [100 numpy exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100).
The exercises themselves are due to various authors, and the collection (and idea, as far as I can tell) is due to [@rougier](https://github.com/rougier). 

This fork uses the PyTorch library instead, and where applicable highlights differences in their APIs. 

### Usage
Try your hand at each of the exercises directly in the Jupyter notebook.

You can look at hints for each question by running, e.g.: `hint(10)`.

You can see the suggested solution by running `solution(10)`. Note that solutions are not designed to be exhaustive â€“ there's usually more than one way to achieve the desired behaviour.
